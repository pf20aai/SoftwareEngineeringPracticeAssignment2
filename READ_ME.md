Much of this code has been taken from my assignment 1 as this assignment contains the testing for it.

The new files for this assignment are this one and all other files within the "test" directory. Additionally, "objects.py" has been altered so all tests pass.

To use this code: Open the test file in your chosen editor. Run unit tests. The test results should stay: 12/12 passed
